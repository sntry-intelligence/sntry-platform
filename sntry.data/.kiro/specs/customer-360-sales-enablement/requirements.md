# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to establish a unified 360-degree customer view and real-time sales enablement platform for Miracle Corporation Limited. The system will integrate external data mining (Instagram, social media, online directories), legacy system data (QuickBooks, Google Sheets/Excel), and advanced analytics to empower sales representatives with real-time customer behavior insights. The platform will drive measurable day-over-day, week-over-week, and month-after-month sales growth through personalized customer interactions, proactive engagement, and data-driven decision making.

The system combines data acquisition, processing, storage, and visualization layers with a comprehensive analytics framework supporting Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, and Prescriptive analysis. The ultimate goal is to transform disparate data sources into actionable intelligence that enables hyper-personalized customer interactions and accelerated sales growth.
