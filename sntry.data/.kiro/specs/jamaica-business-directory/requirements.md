# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that extracts business contact and address information from Jamaica Yellow Pages online directories, transforms this raw data into standardized geocoded records, and dynamically visualizes these businesses on a custom Google MyMaps instance. The system will leverage Python-based technologies including FastAPI, Playwright for web scraping, PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial data management, and Google Maps Platform APIs for geocoding and visualization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Web Scraping and Data Acquisition

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to systematically extract business information from Jamaica Yellow Pages directories, so that I can build a comprehensive database of Jamaican businesses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initiates a scrape THEN it SHALL extract business data from findyello.com and workandjam.com
2. WHEN encountering JavaScript-rendered content THEN the system SHALL use Playwright to handle dynamic content loading
3. WHEN scraping business listings THEN the system SHALL capture business name, address, phone number, email, website, category, and description
4. WHEN facing anti-bot measures THEN the system SHALL implement human-like behavior simulation and rate limiting
5. WHEN pagination is encountered THEN the system SHALL navigate through all pages to ensure complete data extraction
6. WHEN scraping fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2: Data Processing and Standardization

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want clean and standardized business data, so that I can perform accurate geocoding and analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN raw scraped data is received THEN the system SHALL perform exact deduplication using business name and address
2. WHEN near-duplicate records are detected THEN the system SHALL use fuzzy string matching with 80% similarity threshold
3. WHEN processing Jamaican addresses THEN the system SHALL use Libpostal for address parsing and standardization
4. WHEN address components are missing THEN the system SHALL flag records for manual review
5. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and mark records with appropriate status
6. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain data lineage tracking for all transformations

### Requirement 3: Geospatial Data Integration

**User Story:** As a map user, I want to see business locations accurately plotted on a map, so that I can find businesses by geographic location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN standardized addresses are available THEN the system SHALL use Google Geocoding API to obtain coordinates
2. WHEN geocoding succeeds THEN the system SHALL store latitude, longitude, and Google Place ID
3. WHEN geocoding fails with ZERO_RESULTS THEN the system SHALL log the address for manual review
4. WHEN API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement caching and rate limiting strategies
5. WHEN coordinates are obtained THEN the system SHALL store them in PostGIS GEOGRAPHY format with SRID 4326
6. WHEN spatial queries are needed THEN the system SHALL support radius-based business searches

### Requirement 4: RESTful API Development

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a well-defined API to access business data, so that I can build applications that consume this information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide full CRUD operations for business records
2. WHEN retrieving businesses THEN the system SHALL support pagination, filtering by category and location
3. WHEN searching businesses THEN the system SHALL support keyword search and proximity-based queries
4. WHEN triggering scraping tasks THEN the system SHALL return task IDs for asynchronous processing
5. WHEN requesting map data THEN the system SHALL provide GeoJSON and KML format exports
6. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 5: Database Architecture and Storage

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a robust database system that efficiently stores and queries geospatial business data, so that the application performs well at scale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing business data THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
2. WHEN organizing data THEN the system SHALL implement proper schema design with business_data namespace
3. WHEN storing coordinates THEN the system SHALL use GEOGRAPHY(Point, 4326) data type for accurate spatial calculations
4. WHEN performing spatial queries THEN the system SHALL utilize spatial indexing for optimal performance
5. WHEN tracking data changes THEN the system SHALL maintain timestamps for scraping and geocoding activities
6. WHEN managing data lifecycle THEN the system SHALL support soft deletion with is_active flags

### Requirement 6: Dynamic Map Visualization

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to view businesses on an interactive map with detailed information, so that I can explore and discover businesses by location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying the map THEN the system SHALL use Google Maps JavaScript API for rendering
2. WHEN showing business locations THEN the system SHALL place markers with accurate coordinates
3. WHEN clicking markers THEN the system SHALL display business details in info windows
4. WHEN loading map data THEN the system SHALL consume data from FastAPI endpoints in real-time
5. WHEN integrating with MyMaps THEN the system SHALL support KML/GeoJSON export for manual import
6. WHEN customizing the map THEN the system SHALL allow styling and categorization of business markers

### Requirement 7: System Monitoring and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and automated maintenance capabilities, so that I can ensure system reliability and data freshness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system events occur THEN the system SHALL log all scraping, geocoding, and API activities
2. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL send automated alerts for critical failures
3. WHEN data becomes stale THEN the system SHALL implement scheduled incremental updates
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track API response times and database query performance
5. WHEN managing costs THEN the system SHALL monitor Google API usage and implement cost controls
6. WHEN maintaining data quality THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards for data freshness and accuracy metrics

### Requirement 8: Security and Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want secure handling of API keys and sensitive configuration, so that the system maintains proper security posture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing API keys THEN the system SHALL use environment variables and never hardcode credentials
2. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL use cloud-native secret management services
3. WHEN accessing external APIs THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication and authorization
4. WHEN handling user data THEN the system SHALL comply with data protection regulations
5. WHEN configuring the system THEN the system SHALL separate configuration from code
6. WHEN rotating credentials THEN the system SHALL support dynamic credential updates without downtime
