# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a comprehensive AI agent framework that integrates advanced training methodologies, sophisticated orchestration capabilities, and scalable ML workflow deployment. The framework will combine LLM specialization techniques (prompt engineering and fine-tuning), reinforcement learning for agent training, LangChain orchestration protocols (MCP, ACP, RAG), and secure API endpoint exposure for production deployment.
